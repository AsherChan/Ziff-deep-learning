# Convolutional Neural Network trained on CIFAR-10 - Image Augmentation

## What is in this repo

This repo contains jupyter notebook of image augumentation for deep learning using Keras ImageDataGenerator API. 

*image_augmentation.ipynb*

* In this notebook, I demonstarte how to use Keras ImageDataGenerator API to generate augmented images. It is useful when training deep neural network with small set of image data. Custom augmentation, such as histogram equalization is also used adjust constrast of images.

* My blog post discussing how to generate augmented images using Keras ImageDataGenerator API : Image Augmentation for Deep Learning — Histogram Equalization
