# Convolutional Neural Network trained on CIFAR-10 - Learning Rate Schedule and Adaptive Learning


## What is in this repo

*CIFAR10-lrate.ipynb*

* In this notebook, I compare the performance of different learing rate schedules and different adaptve gradient descent algorithms. 

* My blog post discussing how to use Keras LearningRateScheduler API to create custom learning rate schedules and compare the perfromance with adaptive gradient descent algorithms : [Image Augmentation for Deep Learning — Histogram Equalization](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/image-augmentation-for-deep-learning-histogram-equalization-a71387f609b2)
